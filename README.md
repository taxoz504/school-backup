# school-backup

This script will take the folder in the path variable and zip it, then set it off to a remote server

The settings.ini file needs to be edited for this to work with a vaild FTP server login and a path to the folder you want to backup
for the SERVERPATH i.g path/to/folder - NOT path/to/folder/
